I am an Electrical Engineering Undergraduate, currently in my 4th year. I am enrolled in a 5-year integrated Masters' programme.  The primary object of my interest is Machine Learning, particularly Bayesian ML. 

Recently, in the fall of 2018, I did a 6-month stint at the Max Planck Insitute for Intelligent Systems(MPI-IS) in Tuebingen, Germany. I was fortunate enough to be supervised during this period by Dr [Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/), and worked alongside Dr [Antonio Vergari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YK0NLaUAAAAJ&hl=en), who taught me several tricks of the trade in research :). My work in MPI-IS was primarily focused on Bayesian Nonparametrics and Hawkes Processes. You can find our work in the publications page.

Earlier, I worked on term-projects for courses such as Statistical Learning Theory, Bayesian Machine Learning, Introduction to NLP, and Data-Driven Program Analysis. Reports of some of these are available in the _Reports_ section of the publications page.

I was exposed to a wide range of research topics during my internship at MPI-IS. Some of these topics that I wish to explore in the immediate future are:
1. _Scalable Bayesian Inference_, particularly _gradient-based MCMC_ techniques, on a range of data including _temporal data_.
2. _Causal Inference_, including _counterfactual inference_ applied in the context of _fairness_ in ML.
3. _Time series_ analysis
4. Causal Inference in time series, particularly the connections between _Pearl_ causal model and _Granger_ causality

If you're interested in collaboration with me or ask me anything, please do not hesitate to contact me! I plan to post occasional blog posts on topics that interest me, so you might want to check up on the site from time to time :).

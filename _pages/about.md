I am an Electrical Engineering student at IIT Kanpur. I am enrolled in a 5-year integrated Masters' programme.  The primary object of my interest is Machine Learning, particularly Bayesian ML. 

Recently, in the fall of 2018, I did a 6-month stint at the Max Planck Insitute for Intelligent Systems(MPI-IS) in Tuebingen, Germany. I was fortunate enough to be supervised during this period by Dr [Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/), and worked alongside Dr [Antonio Vergari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YK0NLaUAAAAJ&hl=en), who taught me several tricks of the trade in research :). My work in MPI-IS was primarily focused on Bayesian Nonparametrics and Hawkes Processes. You can find our work in the publications page.

Currently, during the Summer of '19, I am interning in the Department of CS at Aalto University in the [Computational Systems Biology Group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/csb/). Here I am supervised by Dr [Harri Lahdesmaki](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/harrila/) and work with Dr [Markus Heinonen](https://users.aalto.fi/~heinom10/) and [Çağatay Yıldız](http://cagatayyildiz.github.io/). My work here revolves around designing scalable, higher-order, gradient-based MCMC samplers for inference in ODE systems, which are parameterized by Neural Networks or Gaussian Processes. 

Earlier, I worked on term-projects for courses such as Statistical Learning Theory, Bayesian Machine Learning, Introduction to NLP, Convex Optimization, and Data-Driven Program Analysis. Reports of some of these are available in the _Reports_ section of the publications page.

My interests, though concentrated around Bayesian ML, have been constantly evolving. My current research interest is in developing:
1. _scalable Bayesian inference_, particularly _gradient-based MCMC_ techniques,
2. to get accurate _uncertainty estimates_ for _complex data_ ,
3. while employing _flexible models_, such as _nonparametric_ Bayesian models and _continuous-time models_.

If you're interested in collaboration with me, feel free to contact me! I plan to start posting occasional blog posts on topics that interest me, so you might want to check up on the site from time to time :).
